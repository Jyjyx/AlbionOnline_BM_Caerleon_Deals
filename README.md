a simple python script to check the prices difference between the black market and the caerleon market.


TO MAKE IT WORK :
first lauch the request_prices.py wait for the processing , when it's done lauch the json_analyzer_1.py






The script check basically for the quality 1 if you want to change it :
  go to the request_prices.py in line 32 at the end of the url you can change the quality ;
    quality=1 : for normal
    quality=2 : for acceptable
    quality=3 : for outstanding etc.....
in a next version the script will check for all qualities.
